# Intro
A not-so-sucking way to install a lot of different masternodes. 

MAIN REPO MOVED TO https://masternodes.github.io/vps/

I am quite confident this is the single best and almost effortless way to setup different crypto masternodes, without bothering too much about the setup part. Vultr is highly recommended for this kind of setup, i even created an [easy step-by-step guide for this provider](https://github.com/marsmensch/masternode-vps-setup/blob/templates/docs/masternode_vps.md).

Feel free to use my reflink to signup and receive a bonus w/ vultr: <a href="https://www.vultr.com/?ref=6903922"><img src="https://www.vultr.com/media/banner_2.png" width="468" height="60"></a>

Thank you!

**Have fun, this is crypto after all!**
